"""Constraint comparator — sub-object diff for table constraints (task P2-DIFF-05).

This module provides :class:`ConstraintComparator`, a focused, independently-
testable unit that compares the constraint sets of two table snapshots and emits
:class:`~pgschemadiff.domain.delta.constraint.AddConstraint` /
:class:`~pgschemadiff.domain.delta.constraint.DropConstraint` deltas.

Design notes
------------
Constraints are **sub-objects of a table**; the :class:`DiffEngine` visitor
dispatches at the table level (SCHEMA / EXTENSION / TABLE / INDEX), not at
CONSTRAINT level.  There is therefore no engine-level ``Comparator`` registration
for ``ObjectKind.CONSTRAINT``.  Instead, :class:`ConstraintComparator` exposes:

* ``kind = ObjectKind.CONSTRAINT`` — for discoverability and consistent typing.
* ``compare_sets(table_ref, source, target)`` — the primary API, called by the
  table comparator (P2-DIFF-02) which holds both the source and target
  ``Table.constraints`` tuples.

Immutability semantics (Postgres constraints are structurally immutable)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL provides no ``ALTER CONSTRAINT … SET COLUMNS`` or similar DDL for
structural changes.  Any change to a constraint's definition — its columns,
CHECK expression, referenced table, ON DELETE/ON UPDATE actions, match type,
exclusion elements, uniqueness semantics — requires a ``DROP CONSTRAINT`` +
``ADD CONSTRAINT`` cycle.

Accordingly, when a constraint with the same ``name`` exists on both sides but
its definition differs (any field other than ``name`` differs), this comparator
emits **two** deltas: a :class:`DropConstraint` for the old definition followed
by an :class:`AddConstraint` for the new definition (a "replace" expressed as
drop+add).  There is no ``ReplaceConstraint`` delta class — see the rationale in
:mod:`pgschemadiff.domain.delta.constraint` for why independent Drop + Add is
preferable to an atomic Replace for the risk-classification and topo-sort steps.

Delta ordering
--------------
Deltas are emitted in **constraint-name-sorted** order (lexicographic, ascending
on ``constraint.name``).  For a replaced constraint (same name, different
definition), the ``DropConstraint`` is emitted *before* the ``AddConstraint``
so that the SQL emitter / topo-sorter always sees a logically valid sequence:
you must DROP the old before ADDing the new.

ObjectRef construction
----------------------
Each delta's ``target`` is built as::

    ObjectRef(
        kind=ObjectKind.CONSTRAINT,
        qname=QualifiedName(namespace=table_ref.qname.namespace, name=constraint.name),
        parent=table_ref,
    )

The ``namespace`` mirrors the owning table's namespace so that the CONSTRAINT
``ObjectRef`` is fully namespaced without additional parameters.

Layer contract
--------------
Pure application layer: domain + stdlib only.  No IO, no async, no psycopg, no
infrastructure or presentation imports.

class ConstraintComparator:
    """Compare the constraint sets of two table snapshots.

    This comparator is a **sub-object comparator**: it is not registered with
    the :class:`~pgschemadiff.application.diff.engine.DiffEngine` (which only
    handles top-level object kinds).  Instead it is delegated to by the table
    comparator (P2-DIFF-02).

    Attributes
    ----------
    kind:
        Always ``ObjectKind.CONSTRAINT``.  Present for discoverability and to
        allow the table comparator to confirm the comparator's coverage without
        hard-coding the string.

    Usage
    -----
    ::

        from pgschemadiff.application.diff.comparators.constraint import (
            ConstraintComparator,
        )

        cmp = ConstraintComparator()
        deltas = cmp.compare_sets(
            table_ref=table.ref,
            source=source_table.constraints,
            target=target_table.constraints,
        )
    """

    kind: ObjectKind = ObjectKind.CONSTRAINT

    def compare_sets(
        self,
        table_ref: ObjectRef,
        source: tuple[Constraint, ...],
        target: tuple[Constraint, ...],
    ) -> tuple[DeltaBase, ...]:
        """Compare two constraint sets and return the ordered delta tuple.

        Matching is performed by ``constraint.name`` (case-sensitive, as
        PostgreSQL constraint names are case-sensitive within a table).

        Rules
        -----
        * Name present in *target* only → emit :class:`AddConstraint`.
        * Name present in *source* only → emit :class:`DropConstraint`.
        * Same name on both sides, **identical** definition (value equality
          across all fields) → no delta emitted.
        * Same name on both sides, **different** definition (any field differs)
          → emit :class:`DropConstraint` (old) then :class:`AddConstraint`
          (new).  There is no ``ReplaceConstraint`` delta; the two independent
          deltas allow the topo-sorter and risk-classifier to handle DROP and
          ADD separately (see module docstring for rationale).

        Ordering
        --------
        Results are sorted by ``constraint.name`` (ascending, lexicographic).
        For a replaced constraint, the :class:`DropConstraint` always precedes
        the :class:`AddConstraint`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        table_ref:
            The :class:`~pgschemadiff.domain.identity.ObjectRef` of the owning
            ``TABLE``.  Used to construct CONSTRAINT ``ObjectRef`` targets with
            the correct ``parent`` and ``namespace``.
        source:
            Constraints from the *current* (source) table snapshot.
        target:
            Constraints from the *desired* (target) table snapshot.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple[DeltaBase, ...]
            Ordered tuple of :class:`AddConstraint` and/or
            :class:`DropConstraint` deltas.  Empty when the two sets are
            identical.
